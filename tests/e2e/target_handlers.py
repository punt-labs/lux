"""Picklable view-logic handlers the harness wires onto a target element.

The harness needs the target element's Hub-side handler chain to do two
separable things on one interaction: run UI/view logic AND announce a
business topic (target.md §Event Models, loop invariants I3 and I6). Two
handlers carry the two halves:

- ``RecordingClickHandler`` — the view half. It counts fires so the
  harness can assert the UI-handler mechanism (D21) ran, and ran exactly
  once, independently of pub-sub.
- ``PublishingHandler`` — the business half for scenarios that announce a
  **non-empty payload**. The ``publish`` wire sugar only ever fires an
  empty payload (the PR-4 default), so a scenario that needs I3's payload
  assertion to have teeth wires this handler instead: a real Hub-side
  handler that publishes ``payload`` to ``topic`` through the production
  ``HubPublishSink`` → ``hub.publish``.

Both are serializable classes (not closures) because the Hub's
authoritative element tree crosses the wire to build the Display replica;
the handler chain must survive native pickling, exactly like the shipped
``_PublishWrappedHandler`` and ``HubPublishSink``. On the replica the
pickled copy never fires — it is folded into a ``RemoteDispatchGroup``
that only sends.
